# Eat-Da-Burger

## Overview

This app allows the user to add, update, and delete burgers from a MySQL database using a front-end interface. Whenever the state of the database is changed, the page displays that new information to the user. In addition to MySQL, this app uses Handlebars for templating and Express for the server.

### Add

Enter a name for the burger you wish to add and click the `Add` button.

### Update

Click the `Devour` button next to the burger you wish to eat, which will update the database and move the burger to the `Devoured Burgers` section.

### Delete

Click the `Garbage` button next to the burger you wish to remove, which will delete from the database and remove the burger from the page.
